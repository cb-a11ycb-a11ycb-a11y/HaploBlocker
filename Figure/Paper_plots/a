Figure 1: 
Schematic overview of the steps of the HaploBlocker method.} Steps include (1) Cluster-building: Classify local haplotype variants in short windows into groups. (2) Cluster-merging: Simplify window cluster by merging and neglecting nodes. (3) Block-identification: Identify blocks based on transition probabilities between nodes. (4) Block-filtering: Creation of a haplotype library by reducing the set of blocks to the most relevant ones for the later application. (5) Block-extension: Extend blocks by single windows and SNPs.

Excerpt of a window cluster. This included all edges (transitions) from the nodes of one of the common paths in the example dataset.

Figure 4:
Graphical representation of the block structure for the first 20'000 SNPs of chromosome 1 in maize. Haplotypes are sorted for similarity in SNP 10'000. In that region block structures are most visible and transitions between blocks can be tracked easily.
