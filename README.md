# HaploBlocker
R-package: Calculation of haplotype blocks and libraries

This is the github repository for your R-package HaploBlocker. 
For a preprint we refer to biorvix (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/19/339788)
For further questions (torsten.pook@uni-goettingen.de)

The explanation on the usage of the package we refer to our Wiki (https://github.com/tpook92/HaploBlocker/wiki) or the equivalent user guidelines

We just upload a new version of the package (1.4.2). This is a development version with some missing documentation - as the old version does not work with the most recent version of RandomFieldsUtils (0.4.0) we still thought it was needed to upload this. 
I will fix this as soon as possible.

We thank Manfred Mayer for this helpful comments on the Wiki/Guidelines
