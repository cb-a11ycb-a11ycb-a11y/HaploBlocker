# HaploBlocker
R-package: Calculation of haplotype blocks and libraries

This is the github repository for your R-package HaploBlocker. 
For a preprint we refer to biorvix (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/19/339788)
For further questions (torsten.pook@uni-goettingen.de)

The explanation on the usage of the package we refer to our Wiki (https://github.com/tpook92/HaploBlocker/wiki) or the equivalent user guidelines

We just upload a new version of the package (1.4.3) that includes function for selection signatures detection (bEHH, iHH), parallel computing for larger windows, and other smaller addon to improve computing time for large datasets as the 1000 Genomes Project.
